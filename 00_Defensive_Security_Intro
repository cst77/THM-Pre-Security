The Security Operations Center (SOC) is the frontline of protecting an organization, operating around the clock, all days a year, and employs a group of security professionals who monitor and protect the networks, systems, and data of an organization. 
A day in the life in SOC would include reviewing alerts, investigating anomalies, and responding to incidents.
Those in SOC are the eyes and ears on the frontline in protecting an organization or system. 

SIEMs are a Defensive Security Radar 
SIEM = Security Information and Event Management systems are the central place for all data and information collected. They offer insight into what is happening within the organization's IT. The systems inside an organization produce a large amount of information, which needs to be brought into this central place.
